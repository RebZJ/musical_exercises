This is just a simple musical exercise generator that I tend to use. I use the interval training to generate interval singing exercises and I use the chord one to generate some chords, will probably add a few more, but I tend to mostly just use the interval singing exercise. Might add a GUI and answers. Feel free to use this however you like! Contributions and ideas will be greatly appreciated too :) 

Get started:

Run main.py and it'll start up, follow and do exercises from there
